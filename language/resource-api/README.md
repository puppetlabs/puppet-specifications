# Puppet Resource API

This library provides a simple way to write new native resources for [Puppet](https://puppet.com).

A _resource_ is the basic unit that is managed by Puppet. Each resource has a set of attributes describing its current state. Some attributes can be changed throughout the lifetime of the resource, whereas others are only reported back but cannot be changed (see `read_only`), and some can only be set once during initial creation (see `init_only`). To gather information about those resources and to enact changes, Puppet requires a _provider_ to implement this interaction. The provider can have parameters that influence its mode of operation (see `parameter`). To describe all these parts to the infrastructure and the consumers, the resource _type_ defines all the metadata, including the list of the attributes. The _provider_ contains the code to _get_ and _set_ the system state.

## Resource definition ("type")

To make the resource known to the Puppet ecosystem, its definition ("type") needs to be registered with Puppet:

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/apt_key.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'apt_key',
  desc: <<-EOS,
    This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage GPG keys needed
    by apt to perform package validation. Apt has it's own GPG keyring that can
    be manipulated through the `apt-key` command.

    apt_key { '6F6B15509CF8E59E6E469F327F438280EF8D349F':
      source => 'http://apt.puppetlabs.com/pubkey.gpg'
    }

    **Autorequires**:
    If Puppet is given the location of a key file which looks like an absolute
    path this type will autorequire that file.
  EOS
  attributes: {
    ensure: {
      type: 'Enum[present, absent]',
      desc: 'Whether this apt key should be present or absent on the target system.'
    },
    id: {
      type:      'Variant[Pattern[/\A(0x)?[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\Z/], Pattern[/\A(0x)?[0-9a-fA-F]{16}\Z/], Pattern[/\A(0x)?[0-9a-fA-F]{40}\Z/]]',
      behaviour: :namevar,
      desc:      'The ID of the key you want to manage.',
    },
    source: {
      type: 'String',
      behaviour: :parameter,
      desc: 'Where to retrieve the key from, can be a HTTP(s) URL, or a local file. Files get automatically required.',
    },
    # ...
    created: {
      type:      'String',
      behaviour: :read_only,
      desc:      'Date the key was created, in ISO format.',
    },
  },
  autorequire: {
    file:    '$source', # will evaluate to the value of the `source` attribute
    package: 'apt',
  },
)
```

The `Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(options)` function takes the following keyword arguments:

- `name`: the name of the resource type.
- `desc`: a doc string that describes the overall working of the resource type, provides examples, and explains prerequisites and known issues. You can also write `desc` as `docs` for backwards compatibility. This compatibility option will no longer be available in the next major revision of the library.
- `attributes`: a hash mapping attribute names to their details. Each attribute is described by a hash containing the Puppet 4 data `type`, a `desc` string, a `default` value, and the `behaviour` of the attribute: `namevar`, `read_only`, `init_only`, or a `parameter`.
  - `type`: the Puppet 4 data type allowed in this attribute.
  - `desc`: a string describing this attribute. This is used in creating the automated API docs with [puppet-strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings).
  - `default`: a default value that will be used by the runtime environment when the caller does not specify a value for this attribute.
  - `behaviour`/`behavior`: how the attribute behaves. Currently available values:
    - `namevar`: marks an attribute as part of the "primary key" or "identity" of the resource. A given set of `namevar` values needs to distinctively identify an instance.
    - `init_only`: this attribute can only be set during the creation of the resource. Its value will be reported going forward, but trying to change it later will lead to an error. For example, the base image for a VM or the UID of a user.
    - `read_only`: values for this attribute will be returned by `get()`, but `set()` is not able to change them. Values for this should never be specified in a manifest. For example, the checksum of a file or the MAC address of a network interface.
    - `parameter`: these attributes influence how the provider behaves and cannot be read from the target system. For example, the target file on inifile or credentials to access an API.
- `autorequire`, `autobefore`, `autosubscribe`, and `autonotify`: a hash mapping resource types to titles. The titles must either be constants, or, if the value starts with a dollar sign, a reference to the value of an attribute. If the specified resources exist in the catalog, Puppet will create the relationsships requested here.
- `features`: a list of API feature names, specifying which optional parts of this spec the provider supports. Currently defined features: `canonicalize`, `custom_insync`, `simple_get_filter`, and `supports_noop`. See below for details.

For autoloading to work, this code needs to go into `lib/puppet/type/<name>.rb` in your module.

### Composite Namevars ("title_patterns")

Each resource being managed must be identified by a unique title. Usually this is fairly straightforward and a single attribute can be used to act as an identifier. Sometimes though, you need a composite of two or more attributes to uniquely identify the resource you want to manage.

If multiple attributes are defined with the `namevar` behaviour, the type must specify `title_patterns` that will tell Resource API how to get at the attributes from the title.

The `title_patterns` are evaluated in the order they are specified. Evaluation stops after the first match is achieved.

Each title pattern contains the:

- `pattern`, which is a ruby regex containing named captures. The names of the captures MUST be that of the namevar attributes.
- `desc`, a short description of what the pattern matches for.

Example:

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/software.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'software',
  desc: <<-DOC,
    This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage ...
  DOC
  title_patterns: [
    {
      pattern: %r{^(?<package>.*[^-])-(?<manager>.*)$},
      desc: 'Where the package and the manager are separated by a hyphen',
    },
    {
      pattern: %r{^(?<package>.*)$},
      desc: 'Where only the package is provided',
    },
  ],
  attributes: {
    ensure: {
      type:    'Enum[present, absent]',
      desc:    'Whether this resource should be present or absent on the target system.',
      default: 'present',
    },
    package: {
      type:      'String',
      desc:      'The name of the package you want to manage.',
      behaviour: :namevar,
    },
    manager: {
      type:      'String',
      desc:      'The system used to install the package.',
      behaviour: :namevar,
    },
  },
)
```

Matches the first title pattern:

```puppet
# /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
software { php-yum:
  ensure => 'present',
}

software { php-gem:
  ensure => 'absent',
}
```

Matches the second title pattern:

```puppet
# /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
software { php:
  ensure  => 'present',
  manager => 'yum',
}
```

## Resource implementation ("provider")

To affect changes, a resource requires an implementation that makes the universe's state available to Puppet, and causes the changes to bring reality to whatever state is requested in the catalog. The two fundamental operations to manage resources are reading and writing system state. These operations are implemented as `get` and `set`. The implementation itself is a basic Ruby class in the `Puppet::Provider` namespace, named after the type using CamelCase.

> Note: Due to the way Puppet autoload works, this has to be in a file called `puppet/provider/<type_name>/<type_name>.rb`. The class will also have the CamelCased type name twice.

At runtime, the current and intended system states for a specific resource. These are always represented as Ruby hashes of the resource's attributes and applicable operational parameters.

```ruby
# lib/puppet/provider/apt_key/apt_key.rb
class Puppet::Provider::AptKey::AptKey
  def get(context)
    [
      {
        name: 'name',
        ensure: 'present',
        created: '2017-01-01',
        # ...
      },
      # ...
    ]
  end

  def set(context, changes)
    changes.each do |name, change|
      is = change.has_key? :is ? change[:is] : get_single(name)
      should = change[:should]
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

The `get` method reports the current state of the managed resources. It returns an enumerable of all existing resources. Each resource is a hash with attribute names as keys, and their respective values as values.

- It is an error to return values not matching the type specified in the resource type.
- If a requested resource is not listed in the result, it is considered to not exist on the system.
- If the `get` method raises an exception, the provider is marked as unavailable during the current run, and all resources of this type will fail in the current transaction. The exception message will be reported to the user.
- If the type has more than one namevar, each resource hash must have a `:title` key with a single formatted string representing all namevar values. The title must match one of the title patterns. The namevar values computed from that pattern must match their counterparts in the hash.

  > Note: This value allows the runtime environment to present resources in a way familiar to the user.

  > Example: Referring back to the `software` example above, resources returned from the `get` method require a `title:` value matching the `package:` and `manager:` values:
  >
  > ```
  > {
  >     title: 'php-yum',
  >     package: 'php',
  >     manager: 'yum',
  >     ensure: 'present',
  > }
  > ```

The `set` method updates resources to a new state. The `changes` parameter gets passed a hash of change requests, keyed by the resource's name. Each value is another hash with the optional `:is` and `:should` keys. At least one of the two has to be specified. The values will be of the same shape as those returned by `get`. After the `set`, all resources should be in the state defined by the `:should` values.

> Example for a `changes` request:
>
> ```
> changes = {
>   'foo' => {
>     is: {
>       name: 'foo',
>       ensure: 'present',
>       value: 'original value',
>     },
>     should: {
>       name: 'foo',
>       ensure: 'present',
>       value: 'new value',
>     },
>   },
> }
> ```

A missing `:should` entry indicates that a resource should be removed from the system. Even a type implementing the `ensure => [present, absent]` attribute pattern still has to react correctly on a missing `:should` entry. `:is` may contain the last available system state from a prior `get` call. If the `:is` value is `nil`, the resources were not found by `get`. If there is no `:is` key, the runtime did not have a cached state available.

If a type has more than one namevar, the resource's name key is replaced by a hash of the namevars and their values:

> Example for a `changes` request with multiple namevars:
>
> ```
> changes = {
>   { package: 'php', manager: 'yum' } => {
>     is: {
>       package: 'php',
>       manager: 'yum',
>       ensure: 'present',
>       value: 'original value',
>     },
>     should: {
>       package: 'php',
>       manager: 'yum',
>       ensure: 'present',
>       value: 'new value',
>     },
>   },
> }
> ```

The `set` method should always return `nil`. Any progress signaling should be done through the logging utilities described below. If the `set` method throws an exception, all resources that should change in this call and haven't already been marked with a definite state, will be marked as failed. The runtime will only call the `set` method if there are changes to be made, especially in the case of resources marked with `noop => true` (either locally or through a global flag). The runtime will not pass them to `set`. See `supports_noop` below for changing this behaviour if required.

Both methods take a `context` parameter which provides utilities from the runtime environment, and is described in more detail in its own section below.

## Implementing simple providers

In many cases, the resource type follows the conventional patterns of puppet, and does not gain from the complexities around batch-processing changes. For those cases, the `SimpleProvider` class supplies a proven foundation that reduces the amount of code necessary to get going.

`SimpleProvider` requires that your type follows some common conventions:

- if the type has a single namevar attribute, it must be called `name`
- `ensure` attribute is present and has the `Enum[absent, present]` type

To start using `SimpleProvider`, inherit from the class like this:

```ruby
require 'puppet/resource_api/simple_provider'

# Implementation for the apt_key type using the Resource API.
class Puppet::Provider::AptKey::AptKey < Puppet::ResourceApi::SimpleProvider
  # ...
```

Once all of that is in place, instead of the `set` method, the provider needs to implement the `create`, `update` or `delete` methods:

- `create(context, name, should)`: This is called when a new resource should be created.
- `update(context, name, should)`: This is called when a resource should be updated.
- `delete(context, name)`: This is called when a resource should be deleted.

The parameters of these methods always carry the same values:

- `context`: provides utilities from the runtime environment, and is described in more detail in its own section below.
- `name`: the name (if there is only one namevar) or hash of namevars (if there are multiple) of the resource.
- `should`: a hash of the desired state of the attributes. This is not passed to the delete method.

The `SimpleProvider` takes care of basic logging, and error handling.

When a `type` has only a single namevar defined, `SimpleProvider` will pass the value of that attribute as `name` to the `create`, `update` and `delete` methods. If multiple namevars are defined, `SimpleProvider` will instead pass a hash. The hash contains all the namevars and their values, for example:

```
{
  name: 'bar',
  group: 'foo',
}
```

## Provider features

There are some use cases where an implementation provides a better experience than the default runtime environment provides. To avoid burdening the simplest providers with that additional complexity, these cases are hidden behind feature flags. To enable the special handling, the resource definition has a `feature` key to list all features implemented by the provider.

### Provider feature: `canonicalize`

Allows the provider to accept a wide range of formats for values without confusing the user.

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/apt_key.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'apt_key',
  features: [ 'canonicalize' ],
)

# lib/puppet/provider/apt_key/apt_key.rb
class Puppet::Provider::AptKey::AptKey
  def canonicalize(context, resources)
    resources.each do |r|
      r[:id] = if r[:id].start_with?('0x')
                 r[:id][2..-1].upcase
               else
                 r[:id].upcase
               end
    end
  end
```

The runtime environment needs to compare user input from the manifest (the desired state) with values returned from `get` (the actual state) to determine whether or not changes need to be affected. In simple cases, a provider will only accept values from the manifest in the same format as `get` returns. No extra work is required, as a value comparison will suffice. This places a high burden on the user to provide values in an unnaturally constrained format. In the example, the `apt_key` name is a hexadecimal number that can be written with, and without, the `'0x'` prefix, and the casing of the digits is irrelevant. A value comparison on the strings would cause false positives if the user input format that does not match. There is no hexadecimal type in the Puppet language. To address this, the provider can specify the `canonicalize` feature and implement the `canonicalize` method.

The `canonicalize` method transforms its `resources` argument into the standard format required by the rest of the provider. The `resources` argument to `canonicalize` is an enumerable of resource hashes matching the structure returned by `get`. It returns all passed values in the same structure with the required transformations applied. It is free to reuse or recreate the data structures passed in as arguments. The runtime environment must use `canonicalize` before comparing user input values with values returned from `get`. The runtime environment always passes canonicalized values into `set`. If the runtime environment requires the original values for later processing, it protects itself from modifications to the objects passed into `canonicalize`, for example through creating a deep copy of the objects.

The `context` parameter provides utilities from the runtime environment, and is described in more detail there. It is the same as is passed to `get` and `set`.

> Example: The `resources` parameter is an array of resources hashes:
>
> ```ruby
> resources = [
>   {
>     id: '0x12345678',
>     source: '/net/gold/example.com/www/key1.gpg',
>   },
>   {
>     id: '1234567812345678123456781234567812345678',
>     source: '/net/gold/example.com/www/key2.gpg',
>   },
> ]
> ```

> Note: When the provider implements canonicalization, it aims to always log the canonicalized values. As a result of `get` and `set` producing and consuming canonically formatted values, this is not expected to present extra cost.

A side effect of these rules is that the canonicalization of `get`'s return value must not change the processed values.
Runtime environments may have strict or development modes that check this property.

For example, in the Puppet runtime environment this is bound to the `strict` setting, and will follow the established practises there:

```text
# puppet resource --strict=error apt_key ensure=present
> runtime exception
```

```text
# puppet resource --strict=warning apt_key ensure=present
> warning logged but values changed
```

```text
# puppet resource --strict=off apt_key ensure=present
> values changed
```

### Provider feature: `custom_insync`

Allows for overriding default property `insync?` checking using custom logic in the provider.

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/test_custom_insync.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'test_custom_insync',
  docs: <<-EOS,
      This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage ...
    EOS
  features: ['custom_insync'],
  attributes:   {
    ensure:      {
      type:    'Enum[present, absent]',
      desc:    'Whether this resource should be present or absent on the target system.',
      default: 'present',
    },
    name:        {
      type:      'String',
      desc:      'The name of the resource you want to manage.',
      behaviour: :namevar,
    },
    some_array:  {
      type: 'Optional[Array[String]]',
      desc: 'An array aiding array attestation',
    },
    force: {
      type:      'Boolean',
      desc:      'If true, the specified array is inclusive and must match the existing state exactly.',
      behaviour: :parameter,
      default:   false,
    },
  },
)

# lib/puppet/provider/test_custom_insync/test_custom_insync.rb
class Puppet::Provider::TestCustomInsync::TestCustomInsync < Puppet::ResourceApi::SimpleProvider
  def insync?(context, name, property_name, is_hash, should_hash)
    context.debug("Checking whether #{property_name} is out of sync")
    case property_name
    when :some_array
      if should_hash[:force]
        context.debug("Checking an order independent array")
        return is_hash[property_name].sort == should_hash[property_name].sort
      else
        context.debug("Checking a subset match array")
        found_members = (is_hash[property_name] & should_hash[property_name]).sort
        missing_members = should_hash[property_name].reject { |member| found_members.include?(member) }
        return missing_members.empty? ? true : [false, "Adding missing members #{missing_members}"]
      end
    end
end
```

When you do not specify the `custom_insync` feature flag, the runtime environment uses strict value equality to determine if a resource instance needs to be state-enforced.

When you **do** specify the `custom_insync` feature flag, `insync?` is called once for each of the properties.
You can use `custom_insync` to implement custom state comparisons when the default value-equality is not sufficient.

The `insync?` method is executed once for each of the **properties** (not parameters, read-only, or init attributes) of the type per resource instance.
If no properties were specified in the instance of a resource, `insync?` is not called.
The call happens during application of the catalog when the runtime environment decides whether or not it needs to enforce state on a specific resource.

The `insync?` method **must** return `nil`, `true` or `false` as the result of the property comparison:

- If `insync?` returns `nil`, property comparison is handed back to the runtime environment's built-in property value equality checking.
  - This means that the provider _only_ needs to deal with properties which actually need custom insync logic. All other properties can be ignored, which will return Ruby's default `nil` return value and use default comparison logic.
- If `insync?` returns `true`, the property is treated as insync.
- If `insync?` returns `false`, the property is treated as out of sync and will cause the runtime environment to report a change.
- If `insync?` returns anything other than `nil`, `true`, or `false` for the result an error will be raised explaining that the value returned is invalid.

When the result is `false`, the `insync?` method **may** also return a string to override the default change report messaging:

- If `insync?` returns `false` without a string, the default change report messaging is triggered:
  - e.g. `Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/File[/tmp/foo]/mode: mode changed <is value> to <should value>`
- If `insync?` returns `false` with a string, the string will be passed as the change report message:
  - In the `test_custom_insync` provider example above, if `SomeValue` was specified as a member of `some_array` but not found in the actual state returned from `get`, this change report message would be written:
    ```
    Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Test_custom_insync[something]/some_array: Adding missing members ['SomeValue']`
    ```
  - This enables more accurate and useful change reporting than the default is-to-should reporting surfaced by Puppet.

The `insync?(context, name, property_name, is_hash, should_hash)` method receives the following arguments:

- a `context` to access the runtime environment,
- the `name` of the resource being checked,
- the `property_name` that is currently being inspected for insync status,
- the current state of the resource in `is_hash`, and
- the desired state (canonicalized) in `should_hash`.

#### Using `custom_insync` in a resource without properties

For resources which specify the `custom_insync` feature flag but have _no_ defined properties, the Resource API adds a spectial hidden property —`rsapi_custom_insync_trigger` — which ensures that `insync?` is still called for the resource.
This hidden property is not used or seen anywhere else in the provider, only in the `insync?` method.

As with all calls to `insync?`, a custom change reporting message can be surfaced by returning a string instead of `true` or `false`.
If no custom change reporting message is returned as a string, the change reporting in Puppet (if `false` is returned) will always be:

> Custom insync logic determined that this resource is out of sync

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/test_custom_insync_hidden_property.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'test_custom_insync_hidden_property',
  docs: <<-EOS,
      This type provides Puppet with the capabilities to manage ...
    EOS
  features: ['custom_insync'],
  attributes:   {
    name:        {
      type:      'String',
      desc:      'The name of the resource you want to manage.',
      behaviour: :namevar,
    },
    force: {
      type:      'Boolean',
      desc:      'If true, the resource will be treated as not being insync.',
      behaviour: :parameter,
      default:   false,
    },
  },
)

# lib/puppet/provider/test_custom_insync_hidden_property/test_custom_insync_hidden_property.rb
class Puppet::Provider::TestCustomInsyncHiddenProperty::TestCustomInsyncHiddenProperty
  def get(_context)
    [
      {
        name: 'example'
      }
    ]
  end

  def set(context, changes)
    changes.each do |_name, is_and_should|
      context.notice("Setting with #{is_and_should[:should].inspect}")
    end
  end

  def insync?(context, name, _property_name, is_hash, should_hash)
    context.debug("Checking whether #{name} is out of sync")

    return true unless should_hash[:force]
    context.debug("Out of sync!")
    false
  end
end
```

### Provider feature: `simple_get_filter`

Allows for more efficient querying of the system state when only specific parts are required.

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/apt_key.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'apt_key',
  features: [ 'simple_get_filter' ],
)

# lib/puppet/provider/apt_key/apt_key.rb
class Puppet::Provider::AptKey::AptKey
  def get(context, names = [])
    if names.empty?
      return all_instances
    else
      names.collect { |n| find_instance(n) }
    end
  end
```

Some resources are very expensive to enumerate. The provider can implement `simple_get_filter` to signal extended capabilities of the `get` method to address this. The provider's `get` method will be called with an array of resource names. The `get` method must at least return the resources mentioned in the `names` array, but may return more than those. If the `names` parameter is an empty array, all existing resources should be returned. The `names` parameter defaults to `[]` to allow simple runtimes to ignore this feature.

For types with multiple namevars, the `names` array will consist of hashes of the namevars and their values instead of simple values:

```ruby
[ { package: 'php', manager: 'yum' }, {package: 'mysql', manager: 'yum'} ]
```

The runtime environment calls `get` with a minimal set of names, and keeps track of additional instances returned to avoid double querying. To gain the most benefits from batching implementations, the runtime minimizes the number of calls into `get`.

### Provider feature: `supports_noop`

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/apt_key.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'apt_key',
  features: [ 'supports_noop' ],
)

# lib/puppet/provider/apt_key/apt_key.rb
class Puppet::Provider::AptKey::AptKey
  def set(context, changes, noop: false)
    changes.each do |name, change|
      is = change.has_key? :is ? change[:is] : get_single(name)
      should = change[:should]
      # ...
      do_something unless noop
    end
  end
end
```

When a resource is marked with `noop => true`, either locally or through a global flag, the standard runtime will produce the default change report with a `noop` flag set. In some cases, an implementation provides additional information, for example commands that would get executed, or requires additional evaluation before determining the effective changes, for example the `exec`'s `onlyif` attribute. The resource type specifies the `supports_noop` feature to have `set` called for all resources, even those flagged with `noop`. When the `noop` parameter is set to true, the provider must not change the system state, but only report what it would change. The `noop` parameter should default to `false` to allow simple runtimes to ignore this feature.

### Provider feature: `remote_resource`

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/nx9k_vlan.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'nx9k_vlan',
  features: [ 'remote_resource' ],
  # ...
)

# lib/puppet/provider/nx9k_vlan/nexus.rb
class Puppet::Provider::Nx9k_vlan::Nexus
  def set(context, changes)
    changes.each do |name, change|
      is = change.has_key? :is ? change[:is] : get_single(name)
      should = change[:should]
      # ...
      context.transport.do_something
    end
  end
```

Declaring this feature restricts the resource from being run "locally". It executes all external interactions through the `context.transport` instance. The way the instance is set up is runtime specific. In Puppet, it is configured through the [`device.conf`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/config_file_device.html) file, and only available when running under [`puppet device`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/man/device.html). We recommend using the [device_manager module](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/device_manager) to deploy device configuration and credentials. In Bolt, credentials are passed in through the [`inventory.yaml`](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file.html#remote-targets).

To use remote resources, you need a transport. See below for how they are defined and implemented.

### Transports

```ruby
# lib/puppet/transport/schema/nexus.rb
Puppet::ResourceAPI.register_transport(
  name: 'nexus', # points at class Puppet::Transport::Nexus
  desc: 'Connects to a Cisco Nexus device',
  # features: [], # future extension points
  connection_info: {
    connector_type: {
      type: 'Enum[nxapi, ssh, grpc, pidgeon]',
      desc: 'Which method to use to connect to the host'
    },
    hostname: {
      type: 'String',
      desc: 'The host to connect to.',
    },
    username: {
      type: 'String',
      desc: 'The user.',
    },
    password: {
      type: 'String',
      sensitive: true,
      desc: 'The password to connect.',
    },
    enable_password: {
      type: 'String',
      sensitive: true,
      desc: 'The password escalate to enable access.',
    },
    port: {
      type: 'Integer',
      desc: 'The port to connect to.',
    },
  },
)

#  lib/puppet/transport/nexus.rb
class Puppet::Transport::Nexus
  def initialize(context, connection_info); end
  def verify(context); end
  def facts(context); {}; end
  def close(context); end
end

# lib/puppet/util/network_device/nexus/device.rb
require 'puppet/resource_api/transport/wrapper'
require 'puppet/transport/schema/nexus'

module Puppet::Util::NetworkDevice::Nexus
  class Device < Puppet::ResourceApi::Transport::Wrapper
    def initialize(url_or_config, _options = {})
      super('nexus', url_or_config)
    end
  end
end
```

A transport connects providers to the remote target. It consists of the schema and the implementation. The schema is defined in the same manner as a `Type`, except instead of `attributes` you define `connection_info` which describes the shape of the data which is passed to the implementation for a connection to be made.

Password attributes should also set `sensitive: true` to ensure that the data is handled securely. Attributes marked with this flag allow any UI based off this schema to make appropriate presentation choices. The value will be passed to the transport wrapped in a `Puppet::Pops::Types::PSensitiveType::Sensitive`. This will keep the value from being logged or saved inadvertently while it is being transmitted between components. To access the value within the Transport use the `unwrap` method. e.g. `connection_info[:password].unwrap`.

#### Schema

To align with [Bolt's inventory file](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/inventory_file.html), a transport schema prefers the following keywords (when relevant):

- `uri`: use when you need to specify a specific URL to connect to. Bolt will compute the following keys from the `uri` when possible. In the future more url parts may be computed from the URI.
- `protocol`: use to specify which protocol the transport should use for example `http`, `https`, `ssh` or `tcp`.
- `host`: use to specify an IP or address to connect to.
- `port`: the port the transport should connect to.
- `user`: the user the transport should connect as.
- `password`: the password for the specified user.

Do not use the following keywords when writing a schema:

- `implementations`: reserved by Bolt.
- `name`: transports should use `uri` instead of name.
- `path`: reserved as a uri part.
- `query`: reserved as a uri part.
- `remote-*`: any key starting with `remote-` is reserved for future use.
- `remote-transport`: determines which transport to load. Uses the transport name.
- `run-on`: Bolt uses this keyword to determine which target to proxy to. Transports should not rely on this key.

> Note: Bolt inventory requires you to set a name for every target and always use it for the URI. This means that there is no way to specify `host` separately from the host section of the `name` when parsed as a URI.

#### Implementation

The transport implementation must implement the following methods:

- `initialize(context, connection_info)`
  - `connection_info` contains validated hash matching schema
  - After initialize the transport is expected to be ready for processing requests
  - Any errors to connect to the target (network unreachable, credentials rejected) should be reported by throwing an appropriate exception
  - In some cases (e.g. when the target is a REST API), no processing needs to happen in initialize at all
- `verify(context)`
  - Perform a test to check that the transport can (still) talk to the remote target
  - Raises an exception if the connection check failed
- `facts(context)`
  - Access the target and return a facts hash containing a sensible subset of default facts from [Facter](https://puppet.com/docs/facter/latest/core_facts.html) and more specific facts appropriate for the target
- `close(context)`
  - Close the connection
  - After calling this method the transport will not be used anymore
  - This method should free up any caches and operating system resources (e.g. open connections)
  - This method should never throw an exception

To allow implementors a wide latitude in implementing connection and retry handling, the Resource API does not put a lot of constraints on when and how a transport can fail/error.

1. Retry handling: Transports should implement all low-level retry logic necessary for dealing with network hiccups and service restarts of the target. To avoid cascading low-level issues to other parts of the system, a transport should at most wait 30 seconds for a single target to recover. When the transport has to execute retries, it is communicated to the operator at the `notice` level to raise awareness of transient problems. The transport is encouraged (but, again, not required) to activate its retry logic in the case of recoverable errors (e.g. "target unreachable").

1. On `initialize`, the transport may apply deeper validation to the passed connection information, like mutual exclusivity of optional values (e.g. `password` OR `key`) and throw an `ArgumentError`
1. On `initialize`, the transport may (but doesn't have to) try to establish a connection to the remote target. If this fails due to unrecoverable errors (e.g. "password rejected"), an appropriate exception will be thrown.

1. `verify` and `facts`, like `initialize`, only needs to throw exceptions when unrecoverable errors are encountered, or when the retry logic times out.

1. Any other methods on the transport are to be used by providers and tasks talking to this kind of target. Those operations are free to use any error signalling mechanism that is convenient. Providers and tasks will have to provide appropriate error signalling to the runtime.

#### Bridging into Puppet

Before the Resource API, remote resources were only supported through the `Puppet::Util::NetworkDevice` namespace. To connect your Transport in a way that Puppet understands, you need to provide a shim `Device` class.

```ruby
# lib/puppet/type/nx9k_vlan.rb
Puppet::ResourceApi.register_type(
  name: 'nx9k_vlan',
  features: [ 'remote_resource' ],
  # ...
)

# lib/puppet/util/network_device/nexus/device.rb
require 'puppet/resource_api/transport/wrapper'
# force registering the transport
require 'puppet/transport/schema/nexus'

module Puppet::Util::NetworkDevice::Nexus
  class Device < Puppet::ResourceApi::Transport::Wrapper
    def initialize(url_or_config, _options = {})
      super('nexus', url_or_config)
    end
  end
end
```

Inheriting from `Puppet::ResourceApi::Transport::Wrapper` ensures that the necessary `Device` methods are implemented using your transport. Specify the transport name in the `super` call to make the connection.

> Note that because of the way the Resource API is bundled with Puppet agent packages, agent versions 6.0 through 6.3 are incompatible with this way of executing remote content. These versions will not be supported after [support for PE 2019.0 ends in August 2019](https://puppet.com/misc/puppet-enterprise-lifecycle).

#### Porting existing code

To port your existing device code as a transport, move the class to `Puppet::Transport`, remove mention of the `Puppet::Util::NetworkDevice::Simple::Device` (if it was used) and change the initialisation to accept and process a `connection_info` hash instead of the previous structures. When accessing the `connection_info` in your new transport, change all string keys to symbols (e.g. `'foo'` to `:foo`). Add `context` as first argument to your `initialize` and `facts` method.

The following replacements have provided a good starting point for these changes:

- `Util::NetworkDevice::NAME::Device` -> `ResourceApi::Transport::NAME`
- `puppet/util/network_device/NAME/device` -> `puppet/transport/NAME`
- `device` -> `transport`
- Replace all direct calls to puppet logging with calls into the `context` logger, potentially getting the context instance from the provider.

Of course this list can't be exhaustive and will depend on the specifics of your codebase.

#### Direct Access to Transports

It is possible to use a RSAPI Transport directly using the `connect` method:

`Puppet::ResourceApi::Transport.connect(name, config)`

1. `register` the transport schema for the remote resource by:
   - Directly calling into `Puppet::ResourceApi.register_transport`
   - Loading an existing schema using `require 'puppet/transport/schema/<transportname>`
   - Setting up Puppet's autoloader for `'puppet/transport/schema'`
2. `connect` to the transport by name, passing the connection info
3. When the transport has been initialized, `connect` will return the `Transport` object

See above for possible exceptions coming from initializing a transport.

To get a list of all registered transports, call the `list` method:

`Puppet::ResourceApi::Transport.list`

It will return a hash of all registered transport schemas keyed by their name. Each entry in the list is the transport schema definition as passed to `register_transport`:

```ruby
{
  'nexus' => {
    name: 'nexus',
    desc: 'Connects to a Cisco Nexus device',
    # ...
    # the rest of the transport schema definition here
  },
}
```

## Runtime environment

The primary runtime environment for the provider is the Puppet agent, a long-running daemon process. The provider can also be used in the Puppet apply command, a one-shot version of the agent, or the Puppet resource command, a short-lived command line interface (CLI) process for listing or managing a single resource type. Other callers who want to access the provider will have to imitate these environments.

The primary lifecycle of resource managment in each of these tools is the transaction, a single set of changes, for example a catalog or a CLI invocation. The provider's class will be instantiated once for each transaction. Within that class the provider defines any number of helper methods to support itself. To allow for a transaction to set up the prerequisites for a provider and be used immediately, the provider is instantiated as late as possible. A transaction will usually call `get` once, and may call `set` any number of times to affect change. The object instance hosting the `get` and `set` methods can be used to cache ephemeral state during execution. The provider should not try to cache state outside of its instances. In many cases, such caching won't help as the hosting process will only manage a single transaction. In long-running runtime environments (like the agent) the benefit of the caching needs to be balanced by the cost of the cache at rest, and the lifetime of cache entries, which are only useful when they are longer than the regular `runinterval`.

### Utilities

The runtime environment has some utilities to provide a uniform experience for its users.

#### Logging and reporting

The provider needs to signal changes, successes, and failures to the runtime environment. The `context` is the primary way to do this. It provides a structured logging interface for all provider actions. Using this information the runtime environments can do automatic processing, emit human readable progress information, and provide status messages for operators.

##### General messages

To provide feedback about the overall operation of the provider, the `context` has the usual set of [loglevel](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/metaparameter.html#loglevel) methods that take a string, and pass that up to the runtime environments logging infrastructure.

```ruby
context.warning("Unexpected state detected, continuing in degraded mode.")
```

results in the following message:

```text
Warning: apt_key: Unexpected state detected, continuing in degraded mode.
```

- debug: detailed messages to understand everything that is happening at runtime; shown on request.
- info: regular progress and status messages; especially useful before long-running operations, or before operations that can fail, to provide context to interactive users.
- notice: indicates state changes and other events of notice from the regular operations of the provider.
- warning: signals error conditions that do not (yet) prohibit execution of the main part of the provider; for example, deprecation warnings, temporary errors.
- err: signal error conditions that have caused normal operations to fail.
- critical/alert/emerg: should not be used by resource providers.

See [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) for more details.

##### Signalling resource status

In many simple cases, a provider passes off work to an external tool. Detailed logging happens there, and then reports back to Puppet by acknowledging these changes. Signalling can be:

```ruby
@apt_key_cmd.run(context, action, key_id)
context.processed(key_id, is, should)
```

This will report all changes from `is` to `should`, using default messages.

Providers that want to have more control over the logging throughout the processing can use the more specific `created(title)`, `updated(title)`, `deleted(title)`, `unchanged(title)` methods. To report the change of an attribute, the `context` provides a `attribute_changed(title, attribute, old_value, new_value, message)` method.

##### Logging contexts

Most of those messages are expected to be relative to a specific resource instance, and a specific operation on that instance. To enable detailed logging without repeating key arguments, and to provide consistent error logging, the context provides _logging context_ methods to capture the current action and resource instance:

```ruby
context.updating(title) do
  if apt_key_not_found(title)
    context.warning('Original key not found')
  end

  # Update the key by calling CLI tool
  apt_key(...)

  context.attribute_changed('content', nil, content_hash,
    message: "Replaced with content hash #{content_hash}")
end
```

will result in the following messages:

```text
Debug: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Started updating
Warning: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Updating: Original key not found
Debug: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Executing 'apt-key ...'
Debug: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Successfully executed 'apt-key ...'
Notice: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Updating content: Replaced with content hash E242ED3B
Notice: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Successfully updated
# TODO: update messages to match current log message formats for resource messages
```

In the case of an exception escaping the block, the error is logged appropriately:

```text
Debug: Apt_keyF1D2D2F9]: Started updating
Warning: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Updating: Original key not found
Error: Apt_key[F1D2D2F9]: Updating failed: Something went wrong
# TODO: update messages to match current log message formats for resource messages
```

Logging contexts process all exceptions. [`StandardError`s](https://ruby-doc.org/core/StandardError.html) are assumed to be regular failures in handling resources, and are consumed after logging. Everything else is assumed to be a fatal application-level issue, and is passed up the stack, ending execution. See the [Ruby documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Exception.html) for details on which exceptions are not a `StandardError`.

The equivalent long-hand form with manual error handling:

```ruby
context.updating(title)
begin
  unless title_got_passed_to_set(title)
    raise Puppet::DevError, 'Managing resource outside of requested set: %{title}')
  end

  if apt_key_not_found(title)
    context.warning('Original key not found')
  end

  # Update the key by calling CLI tool
  result = @apt_key_cmd.run(...)

  if result.exitstatus != 0
    context.err(title, "Failed executing apt-key #{...}")
  else
    context.attribute_changed(title, 'content', nil, content_hash,
      message: "Replaced with content hash #{content_hash}")
  end
  context.changed(title)
rescue Exception => e
  context.err(title, e, message: 'Updating failed')
  raise unless e.is_a? StandardError
end
```

This example is only for demonstration purposes. In the normal course of operations, providers should always use the utility functions.

##### Logging reference

The following action/block methods are available:

- Block functions: these functions provide logging and timing around a provider's core actions. If the the passed `&block` returns, the action is recorded as successful. To signal a failure, the block should raise an exception explaining the problem.

  - `creating(titles, message: 'Creating', &block)`
  - `updating(titles, message: 'Updating', &block)`
  - `deleting(titles, message: 'Deleting', &block)`
  - `processing(title, is, should, message: 'Processing', &block)`: generic processing of a resource, produces default change messages for the difference between `is:` and `should:`.
  - `failing(titles, message: 'Failing', &block)`: unlikely to be used often, but provided for completeness - always records a failure.

- Action functions

  - `created(titles, message: 'Created')`
  - `updated(titles, message: 'Updated')`
  - `deleted(titles, message: 'Deleted')`
  - `processed(title, is, should)`: the resource has been processed - produces default logging for the resource and each attribute
  - `failed(titles, message:)`: the resource has not been updated successfully

- Attribute Change notifications

  - `attribute_changed(title, attribute, is, should, message: nil)`: notify the runtime environment that a specific attribute for a specific resource has changed. `is` and `should` are the original and the new value of the attribute. Either can be `nil`.

- Plain messages
  - `debug(message)`
  - `debug(titles, message:)`
  - `info(message)`
  - `info(titles, message:)`
  - `notice(message)`
  - `notice(titles, message:)`
  - `warning(message)`
  - `warning(titles, message:)`
  - `err(message)`
  - `err(titles, message:)`

`titles` can be a single identifier for a resource or an array of values, if the following block batch processes multiple resources in one pass. If that processing is not atomic, providers should instead use the non-block forms of logging, and provide accurate status reporting on the individual parts of update operations.

A single `set()` execution may only log messages for instances that have been passed, as part of the `changes` to process. Logging for instances not requested to be changed will cause an exception - the runtime environment is not prepared for other resources to change.

The provider is free to call different logging methods for different resources in any order it needs to. The only ordering restriction is for all calls specifying the same `title`. The `attribute_changed` logging needs to be done before that resource's action logging, and if a context is opened, needs to be opened before any other logging for this resource.

#### Type Definition

The provider can gain insight into the Type definition through `context.type` utility methods:

- `attributes`
- `ensurable?`
- `feature?(feature)`

`attributes` returns a hash containing the type attributes and their properties.

`ensurable?` will return true if the type contains the `ensure` attribute.

`feature?` will return true if the type supports a given [Provider Feature](#provider-features).

```ruby
# example from simple_provider.rb

def set(context, changes)
  changes.each do |name, change|
  is = if context.type.feature?('simple_get_filter')
         change.key?(:is) ? change[:is] : (get(context, [name]) || []).find { |r| r[:name] == name }
       else
         change.key?(:is) ? change[:is] : (get(context) || []).find { |r| r[:name] == name }
       end
  ...

end
```

## Known limitations

This API is not a full replacement for the power of 3.x style types and providers. Here is an (incomplete) list of missing pieces and thoughts on how to solve these. The goal of the new Resource API is not to be a replacement of the prior one, but to be a simplified way to get results for the majority of use cases.

### Multiple providers for the same type

The original Puppet type and provider API allows multiple providers for the same resource type. This allows the creation of abstract resource types, such as package, which can span multiple operating systems. Automatic selection of an os-appropriate provider means less work for the user, as they don't have to address in their code whether the package needs to be managed using apt or yum.

Allowing multiple providers does not come for free. The previous implementation incurs a number of complexity costs that are shouldered by the type or provider developer.

    attribute sprawl
    disparate feature sets between the different providers for the same abstract type
    complexity in implementation of both the type and provider pieces stemming from the two issues above

The Resource API will not implement support for multiple providers at this time.

Should support for multiple providers be desirable for a given type, the two options are:

1. Use the older, more complex API.
2. Implement multiple similar types using the Resource API, and select the platform-appropriate type in Puppet code. For example:

```puppet
define package (
  Ensure $ensure,
  Enum[apt, rpm] $provider, # have a hiera 5 dynamic binding to a function choosing a sensible default for the current system
  Optional[String] $source  = undef,
  Optional[String] $version = undef,
  Optional[Hash] $options   = { },
) {
  case $provider {
    apt: {
      package_apt { $title:
        ensure          => $ensure,
        source          => $source,
        version         => $version,
        *               => $options,
      }
    }
    rpm: {
      package_rpm { $title:
        ensure => $ensure,
        source => $source,
        *      => $options,
      }
      if defined($version) { fail("RPM doesn't support \$version") }
      # ...
    }
  }
}
```

Neither of these options are ideal; and are documented as a limitation. Improvement ideas include forward porting the status quo by enabling multiple implementations to register for the same definition, or allowing definitions to declare (partial) equivalence to other definitions (ala "apt::package is a package").

### Puppet 4 data types

Currently, only built-in Puppet 4 data types are usable. This is because the type information is required on the agent, but Puppet has not made it available yet. This work is tracked in [PUP-7197](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-7197). Even once that is implemented, modules will have to wait until the functionality is widely available before being able to rely on it.

### Catalog access

There is no way to access the catalog from the provider. Several existing types rely on this to implement advanced functionality. Some of these use cases would be better off being implemented as "external" catalog transformations, instead of munging the catalog from within the compilation process.

### Logging for unmanaged instances

Previously, the provider could provide log messages for resource instances that were not passed into the `set` call. In the current implementation, these will cause an error.

### Automatic relationships constrained to consts and attribute values

The puppet3 type API allows arbitrary code execution for calculating automatic relationship targets. The current approach in the Resource API is more restrained, but allowes understanding the type's needs by inspecting the metadata. This is a tradeoff that can be easily revisited by adding a feature later to allow the provider to implement a custom transformation.

### Commands API

Ruby's native command execution API (`system`, `open3`) is not very user friendly. The first attempt at remediating this failed on getting the necessary dependencies into the puppet-agent package. Follow [PDK-847](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDK-847) for the next try.

### Lazy-loaded attributes

Some attributes are expensive to load, but rarely managed. To ensure responsible (CPU-)resource usage, it should be possible to have those attributes stay dormant, and be loaded only on demand. Currently the API requires all attributes to be loaded at once.
