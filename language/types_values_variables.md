Types, Values, and Variables
===
The Puppet Programming Language is a dynamically typed language, which means that the
type of values are not in general known until *runtime* (when the program logic is evaluated).

The Puppet Programming Language has a type system as well as operations on types.

The Kinds of Types and Values
---
There are two kinds of types in the Puppet Programming Language; *Puppet Types*, and the types of
the underlying runtime "platform" language - the *Platform Types*. There is also a special Puppet Type called *Undef*.

### Platform Types

At present, the only existing implementation of the
Puppet Language is written in Ruby, but there may be other implementations in the future. In general,
the ability to refer to platform types is to allow configuration of a runtime, handle
references to concepts such as plugins. **Regular Programs in the Puppet Programming Language
do not make use of the platform types**.

A Platform type is named after the runtime; currently only `Ruby`. It is a *Parameterized Type* where
the type parameter is a reference to the *type name in the platforms type system* encoded as a Puppet String.

<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  The platform type names <code>Jvm</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>Go</code> are reserved
  for potential future use.
</td></tr>
</table>

As an example, if there is a puppet extension written in Ruby with the name `Puppetx::MyModule::MyClass`, the platform type is `Ruby['Puppetx::MyModule::MyClass']`.

### The Undef Type

There is a special undefined/null/nil type - called `Undef`; the type of the expression `undef`.
Values of the `Undef` type can always undergo a widening reference conversion to any other type. The reverse is however not true; only the value `undef` has the type `Undef`.

A value of `Undef` type is assignable to any other *optional* type with the meaning *it is allowed to have no value*. This is achieved by using the type `Optional[T]` instead of just the type `T`.


## Puppet Types

Puppet Types include the types that are meaningful in a Puppet Program - these are divided into
*Data Types* e.g.:

*  `Integer`
*  `Float`
*  `Boolean`
*  `Regexp`
*  `String`
*  `Array`
*  `Hash`

*Catalog Types* e.g.:

* `Resource`
* `Class`

*Abstract Types* e.g.:

* `Collection`; the parent type of `Array` and `Hash`
* `Scalar`; the parent type of all literal data types (`Integer`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean`)
* `CatalogEntry`; the parent type of all types that are included in a *Puppet Catalog*
* `Data`; a parent type of all kinds of general purpose "data" (`Scalar` and `Array` of `Data`,
  and `Hash` with `Scalar` key and `Data` values).
* `Optional`, either `Undef` or a specific type
* `Variant`; one of a selection of types
* `Enum`; an enumeration of strings
* `Pattern`; an enumeration of regular expression patterns

and *Platform Types*:

* `Callable`; something that can be called (function, lambda)
* `Type`; the type of types
* `Ruby`; the type of runtime (non puppet) types

All types (Platform and Puppet) are organized into one *Type System*.

Optional Typing
---
Typing is optional. When something is not typed, it has the type `Any`.

The Type System
===============

The type system contains both concrete types; `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `String`, `Regexp` (regular expression),
`Array`, `Hash`, `Callable`, and `Ruby` (represents a type in the Ruby type system - i.e. a Class), as well as abstract
types `Scalar`, `Data`, `Collection`, `Pattern`, `Enum`, `Variant`, `Optional`, `Any`, and `Type`. 

The `String` type is optionally parameterized (`String[<from>, <to>]`) with a size constraint.
By default the size is from 0 to +Infinity.

The `Array` and `Hash` types are parameterized, `Array[V]`, and `Hash[K,V]`, where if `K` is omitted, it defaults to `Scalar`, and if `V` is omitted, it defaults to `Data`. `Array` and `Hash` can be further parameterized to constrain their size, the default is from 0 (empty) to +Infinity. The `Tuple` type is a subtype of `Array` that fully specifies the type per index in the `Array`. A `Tuple` can describe optional and required types/size, as well as a repetition of the last specified type. A `Struct` similarly fully specifies the content of a `Hash` as it provides the capability to
individually type the content per key.

The `Integer` type is also parameterized to enable integer range as a type. By default, an `Integer`
represents all integral number +/- Infinity. (See Integer for more information).

The `Enum` and `Pattern` types are subtypes of `String` that describe subsets of all strings; those
that match a concrete enumeration of strings, and those that match regular expression patterns.

Objects in the catalog are of one of the types `Resource`, or `Class`.

The `Ruby` type (i.e. representing a Ruby class not represented by any of the other types) does not have much value in puppet manifests but is valuable when describing bindings of puppet extensions / 
runtime configurations. The Ruby type is parameterized with a string denoting the class name - i.e. `Ruby['Puppet::Bindings']` is a valid type.

The abstract types are:

- `Scalar` - `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `String`, `Pattern`, `Enum`
- `Data` - any `Scalar`, `Array[Data]`, or `Hash[Scalar, Data]`
- `Collection` - any `Array` or `Hash`
- `Variant` - a parameterized type describing a disjoint set of other types
- `Optional` - a convenience type where `Optional[T]` is the same as `Variant[Undef, T]`
- `CatalogEntry` - one of the types Resource (and subtypes), and Class (and subtypes).
- `Any` - any type
- `Type` - the type of types, parameterized with the type it is the meta-type of, e.g. `Type[String]`
  is the type of `String`.

The type hierarchy is shown in the figure below. (A single capital letter denotes a 
reference to a type, lower case type parameters have special processing rules as shown
in section specific to each type). Note that parameterized type may be referenced
without any parameters, in which case type specific rules apply. Also note that the same type
may appear more than once in the hierarchy, typically with different narrower type parameters.

     Any
       |- Literal
       |  |- Numeric
       |  |  |- Integer[from, to]
       |  |     |- (Integer with range inside another Integer)
       |  |  |- Float[from, to]
       |  |     |- (Float with range inside another Float)
       |  |
       |  |- String[from, to]
       |  |  |- Enum[*strings]
       |  |  |- Pattern[*patterns]
       |  |
       |  |- Boolean
       |  |- Regexp[pattern_string]
       |
       |- Collection
       |  |- Array[T]
       |  |  |- Tuple[*types, from, to]
       |  |- Hash[K, V]
       |  |  |- Struct[{ key => T, ...}]
       |
       |- Variant[*types]
       |- Optional[type]
       |
       |- CatalogEntry
       |  |- Resource[type_name, title]
       |  |- Class[class_name]
       |
       |- Undef
       |- Data
       |  |- Scalar
       |  |- Array[Data]
       |  |- Hash[Scalar, Data]
       |  |- Undef
       |
       |- Callable[signature...]
       |- Type[T]
       |- Ruby[class_name]

In addition to these types, a Qualified Reference that does not represent any of the other types is interpreted as `Resource[the_qualified_reference]` (e.g. `File` is shorthand notation for `Resource[File]` / `Resource[file]`).

The descriptions use [Set Algebra Notation][1] to describe properties / operations on types.

Runtime Types
---

An implementation of the Puppet Language is allowed to make efficient use of the underlying
runtime and may choose to represent instances of puppet types using
instances of types
in the platform language's type system. In these cases, it is allowed to map these types
directly to the puppet type system.

### Ruby Object to Type Mapping

The Ruby implementation of the Puppet Programming Language uses the Ruby classes `String`, `Integer` (`Fixnum`, `Bignum`, etc), `Float`, `Hash`, `Array`, `Regexp`, `TrueClass`, `FalseClass`, `NilObj`. Instances of these Ruby types are directly mapped to the corresponding puppet types (e.g. even if an instance of a puppet `String` is an instance of the Ruby class called `String`, it is not interpreted as `Ruby[String]`.

The catalog types are mapped to their corresponding runtime implementation in Ruby.

### Ruby[T]

Represents a type in the platform's type system. The type parameter T
must be of `String` type and contain a valid string representation of the Ruby type. The referenced type does not have to exist; it is still a reference to a type (albeit a currently not existing type). The type must exist when operations are performed on the type (i.e. must be loadable).

An non parameterized Ruby type represents all/any Ruby runtime type.

### Any

Represents the abstract type "any instance".

#### Type Algebra on Any

    Any ∪ Any        → Any
    Any ∪ (T != Any) → Any

### Undef

Represents the notion of "missing value". `Undef` is the type of the expression `undef`.

Values of the `Undef` type can always undergo a widening reference conversion to any other type. The reverse is however not true; only the value `undef` has the type `Undef`.

In practice, to accept a value that may be `Undef`, an `Optional[T]`, or `Variant[Undef, T]`
must be used.

#### Type Algebra on Undef

    Undef ∪ Undef          → Undef
    Undef ∪ (T ∉ Undef)    → Any

### Data

Represents the abstract notion of "data", its subtypes are `Scalar`, and `Array[Data]` or
`Hash[Scalar, Data]`. Further, arrays and hashes may be empty and contain `Undef`. A
hash element key may not be `Undef`.

#### Type Algebra on Data

    Data ∪ Data                 → Data
    Data ∪ Scalar               → Data
    Data ∪ Array[Data]          → Data
    Data ∪ Hash[Scalar, Data]   → Data
    Data ∪ Undef                → Data
    Data ∪ (T ∉ Data)           → Any
 
### Scalar

Represents the abstract notion of "value", its subtypes are `Numeric`, `String` (including subtypes
`Pattern`, and `Enum`), `Boolean`, and `Regexp`.

#### Type Algebra on Scalar

    Scalar ∪ Scalar          → Scalar
    Scalar ∪ (T ∈ Scalar)    → Scalar
    Scalar ∪ (T ∉ Scalar)    → Any

### Numeric

Represents the abstract notion of "number", its subtypes are `Integer`, and `Float`.

#### Type Algebra on Numeric

    Numeric ∪ Numeric          → Numeric
    Numeric ∪ (T ∈ Numeric)    → Numeric
    Numeric ∪ (T ∈ Scalar)     → Scalar
    Numeric ∪ (T ∉ Scalar)     → Any

### Integer ([from, to])

Represents a range of integral numeric value. The default is the range +/- Infinity.

There is no theoretical limit to the smallest or largest number that can be represented
as an implementation should transparently represent the value as either a 32 or 64 bit
machine word, or as a *bignum*. There is a practical limit; while a bignum can grow to
infinite size, computer scientist has yet to invent a computer with infinite amounts of
memory.

The Integer type can optionally be parameterized with `from`, `to` values to provide a range.
The range can be *ascending* or *descending*. (The direction is only important when iterating
over the set of instances as the range of values is the same if `from > to` as when `from < to`).

If `from` is unassigned, the default is -Infinity, and if `to` is unassigned, the default is +Infinity.

From the Puppet Language, the default values are set by using a literal `default`. If only one
parameter is given, it is taken as both `from` and `to`, (thus producing a range of one value).
The `from` and `to` are inclusive. It is not possible to create an empty range (such construct,
if allowed would represent the set of all integers that are not integers, which would make it
a paradox).

Examples:

     Integer[0, default]   # All positive (or 0) integers
     Integer[1, default]   # All positive integers
     Integer[default, 0]   # All negative (or 0) integers
     Integer[default, -1]  # All negative integers

When performing tests in the Puppet Programming Language, a range inside of another is
considered to be less than the wider range (i.e. a subset of). They are equal if, and only
if the lower and upper bounds are equal.

     Integer[1,10] > Integer[2,3]   # => true
     Integer[1,10] == Integer[2,3]  # => false (they are not equal)
     Integer[1,10] > Integer[0,5]   # => false (overlap)
     Integer[1,10] > Integer[1,10]  # => false (not a subset, they are equal)
     Integer[1,10] >= Integer[1,10] # => true (they are equal)
     Integer[1,10] == Integer[1,10] # => true (they are equal)
     
Testing value against range:

     $value =~ Integer[1,10]
     
     $value ? { Integer[1,10] => true }

     case $value {
       Integer[1,10] : { true }
     }
          
Iterating over an integer range:

     Integer[1,5].each |$x| { notice $x } # => notices 1,2,3,4,5
     Integer[5,1].each |$x| { notice $x } # => notices 5,4,3,2,1
     
     Integer[0, default].each |$x| { notice $x } # error, unbound range (infinite)

#### Type Algebra on Integer

    Integer ∪ Integer               → Integer
    Integer ∪ Float                 → Numeric
    Integer ∪ Numeric               → Numeric
    Integer ∪ (T ∈ Scalar)          → Scalar
    Integer ∪ (T ∉ Scalar)          → Any
    Integer[a, b] ∪ Integer[c, d]   → Integer[min(a, c), max(b,d)]

### Float ([from, to])

Represents a range of *inexact* real number values. The default is the range +/- infinity.

A float is an *inexact* real number using the native architecture's double precision floating
point representation. In contrast to `Integer`, operations on `Float` can cause the result to be negative or positive *Infinity* (i.e. it loses precision to the point where there is no value digits left). This is treated as an error in the Puppet Programming Language (it can be observed by dividing a floating point value with 0).

A `Float` range behaves as an `Integer` range and accepts both integer, and float values when
specifying the range. It is not however possible to iterate over a `Float` range.

You can learn more about floating point than you ever want to know from these articles:

* docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html
* wiki.github.com/rdp/ruby_tutorials_core/ruby-talk-faq#wiki-floats_imprecise
* en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems

#### Type Algebra on Float

    Float ∪ Float               → Float
    Float ∪ Integer             → Numeric
    Float ∪ Numeric             → Numeric
    Float ∪ (T ∈ Scalar)        → Scalar
    Float ∪ (T ∉ Scalar)        → Any
    Float[a, b] ∪ Float[c, d]   → Float[min(a, c), max(b,d)]

### String([from, to])

Represents a sequence of Unicode characters up to a maximum length of 2^31-1 (the maximum
non negative 32 bit value).

The `String` type represents all strings. Abstract subtypes of String (`Enum`, `Pattern`) describes subsets matching an enumeration of strings, or those that match an enumeration of patterns
(regular expressions).

A `String` can be parameterized with a size constraint. One or two parameters can be used.
When one parameter is used, it is either an integer value describing the minimum number of
characters in the string, or it is an `Integer` range fully specifying the size range. When
two parameters are used they represent the from and to values as described for the `Integer`
range type.

    'abc' =~ String[1]   # true, has more than one character
    'abc' =~ String[1,2] # false, has more than two characters
    
    $size = Integer[1,2]
    'abc' =~ String[$size] # false, has more than 2 characters

Internally, when performing type inference, the `String` type is also parameterized to the set of
strings it represents - this has very little practical consequence in a Puppet Programs except
when the type system is used from Ruby logic.

Given the input:

     ['a', 'b', 'c']
     
The type is inferred to `Array[String]`, internally the String type also holds the values 
['a', 'b', 'c']]`. This allows type calculations to assert:

     ['a', 'b', 'c'] =~ Array[Pattern['a-z']]  # true


#### Type Algebra on String

The commonality of two strings is the union of the two strings. The notation `String<a>` is
used to describe a String having the string content 'a'. This notation is used in this specification
only, it can not be used in the Puppet Programming Language.

    type_of([a,b,c])                 # => Array[String<a,b,c>]
    String<a,b,c> == String<b,c,a>   # => true
    typeof([String<a,b>, String<c>]) # => Array[Type[String<a,b,c>]]

    String    ∪ String     → String
    String<x> ∪ String<x>  → String<x>
    String<x> ∪ String<y>  → String<x,y>
    String    ∪ Enum       → String
    String<x> ∪ Enum[x]    → String<x>
    String    ∪ Pattern    → String
    String ∪ (T ∈ Scalar)  → Literal
    String ∪ (T ∉ Scalar)  → Any

### Enum[*strings]

Represents all strings that are equal to one of the string type parameters given to the `Enum` type.

Example:

     Enum['port', 'name', 'ip']

When matched against a `String` with a size constraint, all enumerated strings must comply with
the size constraint.
     
#### Type Algebra

The commonality of two `Enum` types is the set operation enum | enum.

     type_of([Enum[a,b,c], Enum[x,b,c]] # => Array[Type[Enum[a,b,c,x]]

### Pattern[*patterns]

Represents all strings that match any of the given patterns (typically one pattern is used).
The type parameters can be a string expression, literal regular expressions, `Pattern` type,
or `Regexp` type (or a mix).

Nothing matches an unparameterized `Pattern` (it would represent strings that are not strings which
is a paradox)

Example:

     Pattern['.*']
     Pattern[/^all of me$/]
     
#### Type Algebra

The commonality of two Pattern types is the set operation pattern | pattern:

     type_of([Pattern[a], Pattern[b]]) # => Array[Type[Pattern[a,b]]]

### Boolean

The types of the boolean expressions `true` and `false`.

### Regexp[pattern]

An unparameterized `Regexp` describes the set of all regular expressions. A parameterized `Regexp`
describe the very narrow set of source expression identical regular expressions.

The type of a Regular Expression produced by a Literal Regular Expression:

     LiteralRegularExpression
       : '/' RegexpString '/'
       ;

A `Regexp` `Type` is created by:

     RegexpTypeExpression
       : 'Regexp' ('[' PatternStringExpression | LiteralRegularExpression ']')?
       ;

     PatternStringExpression<String> : Expression ;

See also Match Expression (`=~` and `!~`) for more usage of the `Regexp` type.

The syntax of the Regular Expression is defined by Ruby's implementation. Puppet's regular
expressions does not support `\A` and `\Z` and does not support options. If `\A` or `\Z` are used
in the regular expression string, these are removed. If an attempt is used to specify options,
this will result in an error (e.g. `/.*/m`).

The result of `Regexp[pattern]` is a parameterized `Regexp` type that in certain operations
can be used instead of a literal regular expression.

<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  The Puppet Programming Language may be given control over options and support \A and \Z in
  the future as it is unclear why this is not already supported. (The omission of these features
  makes it difficult to work with multi line strings and regular expression matching).

#### Type Algebra on Regexp

    Regexp       ∪  Regexp         → Regexp
    Regexp[R]    ∪  Regexp[R]      → Regexp[R]
    Regexp[R]    ∪  Regexp[Q]      → Regexp
    Regexp[?]    ∪  (T ∈ Scalar)   → Scalar
    Regexp[?]    ∪  (T ∉ Scalar)   → Any


### Array[V, from, to]

`Array` represents an ordered collection of elements of type `V`, optionally constrained in
size by the integer range parameters *from* and *to*.
 
The first index in an array instance is a non negative integer and starts with 0.
(Operations in the Puppet Language allows negative values to be used to perform different calculations w.r.t index). See Array [] operation (TODO: REFERENCE TO THIS EXPRESSION SPEC).

The type of `V` is unrestricted.

When used without parameters, the default is `Array[Data]`.

#### Type Algebra on Array

    Array        ∪  Array         → Array
    Array[R]     ∪  Array[R]      → Array[R]
    Array[R]     ∪  Array[Q]      → Array[R ∪ Q]
    Array[R,a,b] ∪  Array[Q,c,d]  → Array[R ∪ Q, min(a,c), max(b,d)]
    Array[?]     ∪  Hash[?,?]     → Collection

### Hash[K, V, from, to]

`Hash` represents an unordered collection of associations between a key (of `K` type), and
a value (of `V` type), optionally constrained in size by the integer range parameters *from* and
*to*.

The types of `K` and `V` are unrestricted.

While the key is generally not restricted, it is recommended that `Undef` is not accepted
as a key (this is the default, and default for hashes that conforms to the `Data` type).

#### Type Algebra on Hash

    Hash          ∪  Hash               → Hash
    Hash[K,V]     ∪  Hash[Q,W]          → Hash[K ∪ Q, V ∪ W]
    Hash[K,V,a,b] ∪  Hash[Q,W,c,d]      → Hash[K ∪ Q, V ∪ W, min(a,c), max(b,d)]
    Hash[?]       ∪  (T ∈ Collection)   → Collection
    Hash[?]       ∪  (T ∉ Collection)   → Any


### Struct Type

The `Struct` type fully specifies the content of a `Hash`. The type is parameterized with a hash where the keys must be non empty strings, and the values must be types.

Here is an example, where the hash must contain the keys mode and path, and mode must have a value that is one of the strings "read", "write", or "update", and the key path must have a `String` value that is at least 1 character in length.

    Struct[{mode=>Enum[read, write, update], path=>String[1]}]
    
A `Struct` type is compatible with a `Hash` type both ways, given that the constraints they express are met. A `Struct` is a `Collection`, but its size is controlled by the specified named entries.

`Struct` supports `Optional` values - this means that a matching hash may either have `undef` bound to a key, or that the key is missing. A hash that has keys not specified in the `Struct` will not match.

An unparameterized `Struct` matches all structs and all hashes.

#### Type Algebra on Struct

    Struct               ∪  Struct             → Struct
    Struct[T]            ∪  Struct[T]          → Struct[x]
    Struct[T]            ∪  Struct[S (S ∉ T)]  → Struct
    Struct[{s => T}]     ∪  Hash[K,V]          → Hash[String ∪ K, T ∪ V]
    Struct[?]            ∪  (T ∈ Collection)   → Collection
    Struct[?]            ∪  (T ∉ Collection)   → Any

### Tuple Type

The `Tuple` type fully specifies the content of an `Array`. It is to `Array` what `Struct` is to `Hash`, with entries identified by their position instead of by name. A variable number of optional and trailing entries can also be specified.

    Tuple[T1, T2]                   # A tuple of exactly T1 and T2
    Tuple[T1, T2, 1]                # A tuple with a variable number of T2 (>= 0)
    Tuple[T1, T2, 1, 3]             # A tuple with a variable number of T2 (0-3 inclusive)
    Tuple[T1, 5, 5]                 # A tuple with exactly 5 T1
    Tuple[T1, 5, 10]                # A tuple 5 to 10 T1
    Tuple[T1, T1, T2, 1, 3]         # A tuple of one T1, two T1, or two T1 followed by T3

All entries in the `Tuple` (except the optional size constraint min/max count) must be a type and denotes that there must be an occurrence of this type at this position. The tuple can be modified such that the min and max occurrences of the given types in the type sequence can be specified. The specification is made with one or two integer values or the keyword `default`. The min/max works the same way as for an `Integer` range. This way, if optional entries are wanted in the tuple the min is set to a value lower than the number of given types, and if the last type should repeat the max is given as a value higher than the number of given types. As an example, a size constraint entered as `Tuple[T, 0, 1]` means `T` occurs 0 or 1 time. If the max is unspecified, it defaults to infinity (which may also be spelled out with the keyword default).

     ["a", 1]     =~ Tuple[String, Integer]      # true
     ["a", 1,2,3] =~ Tuple[String, Integer, 1]   # true
     ["a", 1,2,3] =~ Tuple[String, Integer, 0]   # true
     ["a", 1,2,3] =~ Tuple[String, Integer, 0,2] # false
     ["a", 1,2,3] =~ Tuple[String, Integer, 4]   # true
     ["a", 1,2,3] =~ Tuple[String, Integer, 5]   # false

The `Tuple` type is a subtype of `Collection`. Its size is specified by the given sequence and the size constraint (which defaults to exactly the given sequence).

#### Type Algebra on Tuple

    Array[T] == Tuple[T,0,default]

    Tuple           ∪  Tuple           → Tuple
    Tuple[R, ...]   ∪  Tuple[S, ...]   → Tuple[R ∪ S, ...]


### Collection[to, from]

A Collection is the common type for `Array` and `Hash` (and subtypes `Tuple` and `Struct`), it may optionally be parameterized with a size constraint (`from` a min size to a `max` size). The `to` and `from` parameters 
are the same as for an `Integer` range. The size constraint can also be specified with a
single `Integer` range parameter.

#### Type Algebra on Collection

    Collection  ∪  Collection    → Collection
    Collection  ∪  Array         → Collection
    Collection  ∪  Hash          → Collection
    
    [1,2,3]      =~ Collection[1,3]  # true, size >= 1 and <= 3
    {a=>1, b=>2} =~ Collection[3]    # false, size is < 3

### Variant[*types]

A `Variant` type represents a disjunct set of types. (Other terms used for this in other languages
are Discrimination Union, Disjoint Union, Variant Record, Tagged Union).

Examples:

    $array_of_numbers =~ Array[Variant[Integer[1000, 1999], Integer[10000, default]]]

which is true if all the numbers in an array of numbers are between 1000 and 1999 or >= 10000

#### Type Algebra on Variant

    Variant         ∪  Variant          → Variant
    Variant[*T]     ∪  Variant[*Q]      → Variant[*T | *Q]
    Variant[*T]     ∪  Q                → Variant[*T | Q]
    
    Variant[Optional[T]] == Variant[T, Undef] == Optional[Variant[T]] == Optional[T]

### Optional[T]

The `Optional` type is parameterized with a single type. It represents the given type or
Undef. An unparameterized `Optional` represents nothing.

#### Type Algebra on Optional

    Optional[T]  ∪  T            → T
    Optional[T]  ∪  Undef        → Optional[T]
    Optional[Q]  ∪  Optional[R]  → Optional[T ∪ R]


### Catalog Entry

Represents the abstract notion of "something that is an entry in a puppet catalog". Its
subtypes are `Resource`, and `Class`.

<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  Stage may get its own type in a future specification.
</td></tr>
</table>

### Resource[type_name, *title]

Represents a *Puppet Resource* (a resource managed by Puppet).

The Resource type is parameterized by `type_name`, and optionally `title`(s).

* The `type_name` parameter can be an `Expression` evaluating to a `Resource` type, or a `String`
  containing the name of the resource type (case insensitive).

* The title type parameter is optional and multi valued. Each title is an `Expression` evaluating
  to a `String` representing the title of a resource.
  
* If no title is given, the result is a reference to the type itself; e.g. `Resource[File]`, 
  `Resource['file']`, `Resource[file]` are all references to the puppet resource type called 
  `"File"`.
  
* When a single title is given, the result is a reference to the singleton instance of the
  resource uniquely identified by the title string.
  
* When multiple titles are given, the result is an `Array[Resource[T]]`; e.g.
  `Resource[File, 'a', 'b']`  produces the array `[Resource[File, 'a'], Resource[File, 'b']]`.
  
#### Shorthand Notation

Any Qualified Reference that does not reference a known type is interpreted as a reference
to a `Resource` type. Thus `Resource[File]` and `File` are equivalent references.

The shorthand notated resource types supports type parameterization with title(s). These
are equivalent: `Resource[File, 'a', 'b']`, `File['a', 'b']`, they both produce an equivalent
array of two references - `File['a']` and `File['b']`.

#### Type Algebra on Resource

    Resource <= Resource[RT] <= Resource[RT, T]
    Resource[RT1]   != Resource[RT2]
    Resource[RT, T] != Resource[RT, T2]
    Resource[RT]    == RT
    Resource[RT, T] == RT[T]
    
    Resource        ∪  Resource            → Resource
    Resource[RT]    ∪  Resource[RT]        → Resource[RT]
    Resource[RT1]   ∪  Resource[RT2]       → Resource
    Resource[RT,T]  ∪  Resource[RT, T]     → Resource[RT, T]
    Resource[RT,T1] ∪  Resource[RT, T2]    → Resource[RT]
    Resource[?]     ∪  (T ∈ CatalogEntry)  → CatalogEntry
    Resource[?]     ∪  (T ∉ CatalogEntry)  → Any
    
### Class[*class_name]

Represents a Puppet (Host) Class. The `Class` type is parameterized with the name of
the class (`String`, or Qualified Name).

If multiple class names are given, an `Array` of parameterized `Class` types is produced.

<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
  In 3x it is allowed to also use an upper case Resource reference e.g. <tt>Class[Baz]</tt>. This
  is currently supported in the new implementation. It should not if names are strict as this
  really means
  <tt>Class[Resource[Baz]]</tt>. <b>Discuss if this support should be removed</b>.
</td></tr>
</table>


### Class Inheritance

The type system does not treat (Host) Class inheritance as subtyping.

The reason for this is that if the type system were to do this, then classes need to be loaded in order for type operations to correctly answer if a class inherits another. There is a suspicion
that this may affect the result (logic may reference a class that should not be loaded because
it is used as a condition to load classes that are not present. Loading a class may also have other
side effects as it is not a pure load operation). 

<table><tr><th>Note</th></tr>

  Further work is needed to make a final decision. If the decision is made to keep it the way

</td></tr>
</table>


#### Type Algebra on Class

    Class > Class[c]
    Class       ∪  Class               → Class
    Class[c]    ∪  Class[c]            → Class[c]
    Class[c1]   ∪  Class[c2]           → Class
    Class[?]    ∪  (T ∈ CatalogEntry)  → CatalogEntry
    Class[?]    ∪  (T ∉ CatalogEntry)  → Any

### Type[T]

`Type` is the type of types. It is parameterized by the type e.g the type of `String` is `Type[String]`. Consequently, the type of `Type[String]` is `Type[Type[String]]`, and so on
until infinity.

#### Type Algebra on Type

    Type        ∪  Type                → Type
    Type        ∪  Type[T]             → Type
    Type[T]     ∪  Type[T]             → Type[T]
    Type[?]     ∪  (T ∉ Type)          → Any

### Callable[signature]

`Callable` is the type of callable elements; functions and lambdas. The `Callable` type
will typically not be used literally in the Puppet Language until there is support for
functions written in the Puppet Language.
`Callable` is of importance for those who write functions in Ruby and want to type
check lambdas that are given as arguments to functions in Ruby. They are also important
in error messages when communicating why a given set of arguments do not match a signature.

The signature of a `Callable` denotes the type and multiplicity of the arguments it accepts and consists of a sequence of parameters; a list of types, where the three last entries may optionally be min count, max count, and a `Callable` (which is taken as its block_type).

* If neither min or max are specified the parameters must match exactly.
* A min < size(params) means that the difference is optional. 
* If max > size(params) means that the last type repeats until the given max cap number of arguments
* if max is literal `default`, the max value is unbound (+Infinity).
* If no types and no min/max are given, the Callable describes any callable i.e. `Callable[0, default]` (i.e. no type constraint, and any number of parameters).
* `Callable[0,0]` is a callable that does not accept parameters
* If no types are given, and the min/max count is not `[0,0]`, then the callable describes only the
  untyped arity and it places no constraints on the parameter types, e.g. `Callable[2,2]` means
  callable with 2 parameters.


#### Type Algebra on Callable

`Callable` type algebra is different from other types as it seems to work in reverse. This is because its purpose is to describe the *callability* of the instance, not its essence (even if the type
serves dual purpose by simply reversing the comparison). (This is known as [Contravariance][3] in computer science).
As an example, a lambda that is `Callable[Numeric]` can be called with one
argument being a `Numeric`, `Float`, or an `Integer`, but not with a `Scalar`, or `Any`. Thus, while it seems intuitive that a `Callable[Integer`] should be assignable to a `Callable[Any]` (since `Any` is a wider type), this is not true because it cannot be called with an `Any`. **The reason for checking the type of a callable is to detect if it can be called a certain way** - thus `assignable?(Callable[Any], Callable[Integer])` really is a declaration that there is an *intent to call* the callable with one `Any` argument (which it does not accept).

This also means that generality works the opposite way; `Callable[String] ∪ Callable[Scalar]` yields `Callable[String]` - since both can be called with a `String`, but not with any `Scalar`.

Internally the `Callable` is represented by a `Tuple`, and an optional `Callable` (block). Type algebra is performed on these individually.

    Callable         ∪  Callable                         → Callable[0,default]
    Callable[?]      ∪  T (T ∉ Callable)                 → Any
    Callable[D]      ∪  Callable[E (E == D)]             → Callable[D]
    Callable[D]      ∪  Callable[E (E > D)]              → Callable[D]
    Callable[D]      ∪  Callable[E (E < D)]              → Callable[E]
    Callable[D]      ∪  Callable[E (!(E >= D || E < D))] → Callable

Here the parameter letter denotes the full callable specification (tuple and block):

The rationale of the last expression is that two disjunct callables cannot be called
in a common way e.g. `Callable[Array] ∪ Callable[Integer]` cannot be called with exactly
the same argument, since no such argument exists.

In general:


    B ∈ Callable
    C ∈ Callable
    S ∈ Tuple[X]
    T ∈ Tuple[Y]
    Callable[*S, B]  ∪  Callable[*T, C]    → Callable[*(S ∪ T), B ∪ C]

Here `*S`, `*T` denotes, the syntax of the `Tuple` parameters expanded.


Examples:

    Callable[String] ∪ Callable[Scalar]  → Callable[String]
    Callable[String] ∪ Callable[Numeric] → Callable
    
    A ∈ Callable[String, Callable[String]]
    B ∈ Callable[Scalar, Callable[Scalar]]
    A ∪ B → Callable[String, Callable[String]]

<tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>
A future version of the spec may provide a better generalization of two callables such
that it either preserves the arity, or that a <tt>Variant</tt> of the two callables is
produced. This change will be made if the distinction has practical value.

Operations per Type
---
The operations available per type is specified in the section TODO REF TO OPERATORS DOCUMENT.

Variables
---
A variable is a storage container for a value. Variables are immutable (once assigned they cannot be assigned to another value, and the value it is referring to is also immutable. Variables are also used define parameters of defines, classes, lambdas (and functions) - the term *parameter* is used
to denote such variables.

The type of a non parameter variable is determined by what is assigned to it.
The type of a parameter may be optionally specified in which case a given value for that parameter
must be compliant with the given type. An untyped parameter accepts a value of any type (i.e. `Any`)

### Variable Names

Variable names must conform to the following syntax:

     Variable
       : '$' (NumericVariable | NamedVariable )
       ;
       
     NumericVariable
       : /0|([1-9][0-9]*)/
       ;
       
     NamedVariable
       : /[a-z_]\w*/
       | /(::)?[a-z]\w*(::[a-z]\w*)*/
       ;

* That is, a numeric variable must be a valid decimal number (a name that starts with 0 and has additional digits is also illegal). 
* A named variable must start with a lower case letter a-z or '_' (underscore)
and after that contain any word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or _). Specifically, a hyphen character
or a period are not allowed as they were in some earlier versions of the Puppet Programming Language.
* Also note that it is not allowed to use an upper case letter in the initial position of a name 
segment.
* It is also not allowed to use an underscore in the initial position of a name segment
in a fully qualified variable.

It is illegal to reference a numeric variable with a fully qualified name (i.e. a match result in
another name-space).

### Variable Reference

An expression such as `$x` evaluates to the value bound (assigned) to the variable name. Numeric
variables are assigned as a side effect of evaluating a match expression. SEE TODO REF. It is legal to reference any numeric variable, but it is illegal to reference a named variable that does not exist. A variable that has been assigned, a built in variable, or a variable that represents a parameter value that is provided by the runtime (e.g. meta-parameters) are said to exist.

**In this version of the specification strict variable lookup is optional (controlled by a feature switch). It is not on by default in Puppet 4.x, but will be mandatory in Puppet 5.0.**

### Initial Values of Variables

A Puppet Programming Language Variable comes into existence when an assignment is made to
the variable. There is no such thing as an un-initialized variable since all variables that
exist have a value (even if that value may be the literal `undef` value).

All numeric variables are said to exist. If they have not been set by the last match expression in
the same scope, they evaluate to `undef`.

Variables that have not been assigned, do not exist, and thus do not have a value. When
strict variables feature is turned off, a reference to such a variable results in the value `undef`. 

Conversions and Promotions
===
The Puppet Programming Language is in general dynamically typed (everything is
an Any unless declared otherwise). There are various operators that perform
type conversion.
If required and when possible, there are functions that perform explicit type conversion,
and there are typed parameters that will perform type conversion when required and possible.

The exact conversions are documented per language feature. This section describes the general
conversions and promotions.

Numeric Conversions
---
* When arithmetic operations are done on `Numeric` types - if one or both operands
  are of `Float` type, the result is also of `Float` type.

* There are never any under or overflow when performing integer arithmetic. The implementation
  handles automatic conversion from 32 to 64 bit numbers to bignum.

String to/from Numeric Conversion
---

Automatic conversion between `String` and `Numeric` values are performed only
for certain operations. Only arithmetic operations, comparison, and interpolations
will cause an automatic conversion to occur.

* Arithmetic operations are done on `Numeric` types - if an operand is a `String` an attempt is made
  to transform it into numeric form (rather than giving up immediately).

* Explicit conversion from `Numeric` to `String` can be performed by calling the `sprintf` function.

* `Numeric` values are transformed to their radix 10 representation when interpolated into a string.

* For a `String` to be converted into a `Numeric` the entire string must conform
to the `CONVERTABLE_STRING` grammar. The `NUMBER` is interpreted in the same manner as the rest of the language with respect to radix. The resulting `Numeric` value is positive, unless a `SIGN` was specified, in which case the value has the specified sign.

```
CONVERTABLE_STRING
  : BLANK? (SIGN BLANK?)? NUMBER BLANK?
  ;

BLANK
  : /[[:blank:]]+/
  ;

SIGN
  : '+'
  : '-'
  ;
```

<tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>  
  Automatic String to Number conversion may be deprecated and removed in a future version
  of the specification.
</tr></td>
</table>

Boolean Conversion
---
Puppet has a sense of boolean "truth" and will convert values to `Boolean` as shown below:

     ''        → true
     undef     → false
     false     → false
     any other → true

<table>
<tr><th>Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>  
  3x treats '' as equivalent to `undef`.
</tr></td>
</table>

String to Regexp Conversion
---
If the RHS operand of a match expression evaluates to a String, the string is converted into a regular expression.

To String Conversions
---
### Qualified Name and Qualified Reference to String

Qualified Names evaluate to string type unless the name appears in an expression that uses
the name as a reference to an instance (e.g. the name of a function in a function call).

The reverse is not generally true; a string value can not always be used where a Qualified Name is
allowed (e.g. `$"x"` is not a valid reference to the variable named `'x'`).

### Qualified Reference to String

Qualified References are only converted to String when interpolated into a String expression.

### Hash to String

A Hash is turned into a string when it is interpolated. The string consists of '{' '}' around
a comma separated list of entries where each entry is K '=>' V and K and V are converted to string
form. The resulting string is formatted with one space padding after each comma. No trailing
comma is produced. There is no space after '{' and no space before '}'.

### Array to String

An Array is turned into a string when it is interpolated. The string consists of '[' ']' around
a comma separated list of entries where each entry V is converted to string form. The resulting string is
formatted with one padding space after each comma. No trailing comma is produced. There is no space after '[' and no space before ']'.

### Type to String

A Type is turned into a string when it is interpolated. The string consists of the type name in upper case, and if it is parameterized followed by the string form of the parameters enclosed in '[' ']'.
When there are multiple parameters, they are comma separated, and padded with one space after each comma. There is no space after '[', and no space before ']'. In general the form is compliant
with how the types are specified in Puppet Programming Language source form.

### Regexp to String

A Regexp is turned into a String when it is interpolated. The string consists of the source of
the regular expression as given in the Puppet Programming Language, enclosed in '/' '/'.

### Numeric to String

A Numeric is turned into a String when it is interpolated. The result is in decimal radix.

### Any to String

Conversion of any other type to String is undefined. It will typically be the underlying
runtime system's string representation of the object.
